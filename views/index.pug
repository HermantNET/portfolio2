        h3 Thomas E. Herman Jr.
        p.
          Born and raised in the US state of Florida. From the beggining I've held a special interest in computers.
          This naturally lead to looking for work in the tech industry. When I discovered programming, I quickly fell
          in love. Starting from a python-based language for scripting in the popular video 'Skyrim', I quickly moved onto
          JavaScript and fell in love with how expressive the language was.

        p.
          For the last three years I have continued to hone my craft, and eventually wound up in a techinal college
          studying the .NET ecosystem. I covered most of what one would expect, VB.NET, C#, SQL, ASP.NET, etc. Now I currently seek
          work whether it be freelance, contract, or salaried. I've covered a great deal of technology over the years, and am
          currently invested in the React ecosystem. Some of work can be found at the following links: #[br]#[br]
